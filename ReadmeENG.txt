You are welcome to use "number to word" script to convert amount of money written by number to word in the Azerbaijan language.

1. You can use excel file as a template and do your work on different sheets.(İf you dont have experience with Visual basic, I recommend to use this way)
2. You can import .bas files to visual basic in your excel. 
3. You can use .txt files as a source code and can make changes.

Note: It is not possible(or i found way this easier) write Azəri characters in vba, so i made sheet named "musteri". 
The code read the number words which contains "İ,Ü,Ö,Ş,ı,ə," characters from this sheet. The sheet is protected and password is "12345"

Example is written in the fisrt sheet.

1. To use Avro type function "=SpellNumberAvro()"
2. To use Azn type function "=SpellNumberAzn()"
3. To use Dollar type function "=SpellNumberDollar()"

To open vba use alt + f11 shourtcut keys.

Have fun!
